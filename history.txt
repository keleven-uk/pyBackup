Version = 2020.10

    In pyBackup.py

        Hopefully this is simpler and correct a few bugs.

Version = 2020.08.d410802

    Added three new files.
      myLibrary.py - a wrapper around dictionary access, used to store song stuff.
      myLicense.py - holds the print stuff for short license and long license.
      myConfig.py  - a wrapper class to read a toml config file [replaces _version.py].
    _version.py removed.
    Amended delete file function to use recycle bin, can be overridden to permanently ddelete
      files using command line argument.


Version = 2020.07.a0b55ab

    Program does copy directories with Capital letters, but only if they are not empty.
    So, forward and reverse scans ignore empty directories - probably what we want.
    There was a problem copying files with no extension - changed to glob to ("**/*") from ("**/*.*")
    Added substation of the Current Working Directory for "." - needs testing.


Version = 2020.06.981ef56

    Added myLogger.py, a wrapper of the python logger.  This is a generic module.
    Added logging statement through out the program.
    Found that the removeEmptyDir only delete the child directory, needs several
    runs on the program to completely delete a directory tree.
    Found the program does not copy directories with upper case names - needs work.
    Added timing for the tree phases of the program - forward, reverse and deleting empty destination directories.
    Added program name to _version.py.  Should this be just version.py.


Version = 2020.06.a118bb5

    Changed script description.
    Added a check for is file is copyFiles to stop trying to copy directory.
    Moved the delete file stuff into comapreReverseFiles instead of it's own sub.
    Amended removeEmptyDir
        Only len(os.listdir(f)) gave a true zero value for empty directories.
        Also, tried f.stat().st_size, os.stat(f)[6] & os.path.getsize(f)
    Tried to tidy up the results format.
    Changed to code in getHimanReadable to a simpler one - found on the web.
    Added colour - Error message now print in red.


Version = 2020.05.deab7f8

    Used pathlib for all paths.
    Changed the method to collect all the filename form os.wal to using glob().
    Changed the method of constructing the destination pathname, now uses path.parts.
        Only partly tested on absolute path names only. Needs more testing.
        Changed all print statements to use f string - print(f"{filename})"
    The -v argument now uses the value in __version__ in _version.py.
    Moved the argument validation into parseArgs procedure.

    Added a reverse scan, that will delete file in the destination that no
    longer exist in the source directory.

    Added command argument to print the license and version.

    Change command arguments for source and destination to be optional, but
    checks that they are provided if needed.


Version = 2019.01.429679b

    Basic structure finished.
    Will walk the source directory and pass the filename on for further processing.
    Will copy files across if does not exist in destination directory.
