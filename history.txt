    Version = 1.1.3

    Program does copy directories with Capital letters, but only if they are not empty.
    So, forward and reverse scans ignore empty directories - probably what we want.
    There was a problem copying files with no extension - changed to glob to ("**/*") from ("**/*.*")
    Added substation of the Current Working Directory for "." - needs testing.


    Version = 1.1.2

    Added myLogger.py, a wrapper of the python logger.  This is a generic module.
    Added logging statement through out the program.
    Found that the removeEmptyDir only delete the child directory, needs several
    runs on the program to completely delete a directory tree.
    Found the program does not copy directories with upper case names - needs work.
    Added timing for the tree phases of the program - forward, reverse and deleting empty destination directories.
    Added program name to _version.py.  Should this be just version.py.


    Version = 1.1.1.

    Changed script description.
    Added a check for is file is copyFiles to stop trying to copy directory.
    Moved the delete file stuff into comapreReverseFiles instead of it's own sub.
    Amended removeEmptyDir
        Only len(os.listdir(f)) gave a true zero value for empty directories.
        Also, tried f.stat().st_size, os.stat(f)[6] & os.path.getsize(f)
    Tried to tidy up the results format.
    Changed to code in getHimanReadable to a simpler one - found on the web.
    Added colour - Error message now print in red.


    Version = 1.1.0.

    Used pathlib for all paths.
    Changed the method to collect all the filename form os.wal to using glob().
    Changed the method of constructing the destination pathname, now uses path.parts.
        Only partly tested on absolute path names only. Needs more testing.
        Changed all print statements to use f string - print(f"{filename})"
    The -v argument now uses the value in __version__ in _version.py.
    Moved the argument validation into parseArgs procedure.


    Version = 1.0.4.

    Added LICENSE.txt, history.txt and README.md


    Version = 1.0.3.

    Added the ability to remove empty directories.
    Added the ability to print bytes in a human readable format i.e. in KB or MB etc.


    Version = 1.0.2

    Added file _version.py - holds the current version of the project.

    Update the licence to V3 of the GNU General Public License.

    Added files that have changed size and date to file that are copied across.
    Added a reverse scan, that will delete file in the destination that no
    longer exist in the source directory.

    Added command argument to print the license and version.

    Change command arguments for source and destination to be optional, but
    checks that they are provided if needed.


    Version = 1.0.1

    Basic structure finished.
    Will walk the source directory and pass the filename on for further processing.
    Will copy files across if does not exist in destination directory.
